# url-utility

urlShortener is a url utility project that hosts a server with the following functions:
1. Shortens a long url into a short url (7 characters)
2. On accessing short url, redirect the short url to the original long url

The system comprises of a 

REST based APIs - that accepts a POST call with long url, that is persisted for retrieval at a later time 

Redis server - that stores the short url as the key into Redis cache. The data is saved to the disc so that it is available in case the system restarts or in case of any node failures in a cluster.

The Hash Generator - The hash generated is a 7 character string. Character ranges from [0-9][a-z][A-Z] ~ 62 unique character per position in a 7 character string. With this we can represent upto 3521614606208 urls

We generate random function for each byte array of the size 7. The number generated will range from 0 - 64, but we need the random generator to generate number between 0-61

We will mask the MSB of the generated number if it is greater than 62
number & 0x3F

We can then map the number back to a character using the mapping above

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

install redis server

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

curl -v -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"url":"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-efficient-algorithm-to-find-the-kth-smallest-element-in-an-array-having-n-unordered-elements"}' http://localhost:8080/urlShortner/url/

place url obtained from above into browser. You should be redirected to the long url.
Here are some sample urls generated by the system
127.0.0.1:6379> KEYS *
1) "http://localhost:8080/urlShortner/u/L2sffbp"
2) "http://localhost:8080/urlShortener/342jjiojfj"
3) "http://localhost:8080/u/Uc6owA7"
4) "http://localhost:8080/urlShortener/342jjio"
